# 2048 RL

## 2048 

[2048](https://play2048.co/) is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048(math: 2048 = 2**11).

We use an open-source env of 2048 game, which is OpenAI Gym interface. Thanks for authors @dsgiitr, @rgal and so on.


## RL Algorithms

We are going to release some RL methods to play with 2048.
